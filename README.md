# Project Presentations

As new developers join the Datagrove team, we want to be able to update them on current projects and technologies. This repo will be used to collect presentation outlines and other related information.

## Presentations Should Include:
- Description of your feature or project 
- Why the project is important to Datagrove
- Details including:
   * Language/Framework
   * Packages
   * Development Plan (Features to be implemented/included)
- A set of slides or similar visual representation, including screenshots and other images

## Presentation Outlines:
- Outline the content that you will cover in your presentation in a md file named `yourName_Dec1.md`
- Include screenshots and other images that you will use during your presentation
- Make a pull request with your outline to the Dec. 1 folder in the repo
- Rachael and Meagan will give you feedback on your outline and then you can create slides using the outline content
