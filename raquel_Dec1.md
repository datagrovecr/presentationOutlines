# Outline Presentation for Jafet

## My feature name is: 
Markdown to pdf

## What is the goal?
The markdown file is converted to HTML (that already works) and the new HTML must be converted to PDF (this process is what I'm working on).

---

I use Dart, HTML, and markdown language for this project.

The issues are that the PDF does not show:
- Horizontal line
- List
- Code blocks
- Tables
- Images
- Emojis
- Strikethrough

I already did the following:
- Horizontal lines
- The h1,h2,h3,h4,h5, and h6 with their respective format
- The Strikethrough
- Links (but for now they does not work at 100%)
